### Multi-Threading
The Producting searching algorithm implements multi threading, this will help multiple assests to share resoures, helping to get faster and efficient results. Web scraping consists of requesting resources to a web server. This requires much I/O activity, I/O is much slower than processing, so the CPU would spend much of its time waiting for I/O to be completed, this is why multi threading helps in getting fast results.
